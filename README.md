# a-lil-trivia-game

A single-player/multi-player game that allows the user(s) answer trivia questions. The user(s) can select the number of questions, the category, the difficulty, and the type. The user may also enable a 30-second question timer and assign team names. The app shows the user(s) how many questions each team answered correctly at the end of each game.
I used data from an open source trivia api: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
