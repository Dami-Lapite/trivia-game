# a-lil-trivia-game

A simple react app that allows the user answer trivia questions. The user can select the number of questions, the category, the difficulty, and the type.
The app shows the user how many questions they answered correctly at the end of each game.
I used data from an open source trivia api: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
